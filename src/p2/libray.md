`libray`: a fully-featured raytracing library
=============================================

Raytracing involves a bit of maths, but not a lot of code!

The code of a raytracer can be contained in a business card
<https://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/>

If it's quite simple to do a raytracer, it's way more complicated to
make it run fast (actually it's has you can guess an open research
field) ...

This project is not so much about system programming but about being
able to use way what you know to optimize your program speed.

Bonus if you use your own `libppm` as your `libray` dependency :)
